The goal of this repository is to house useful (online) resources that students/researchers might need when working in our lab. Ideally, it should grow to include material that is useful to approach topics you are not familiar with as well as resources to depeen your knowledge in topics that you know already (but are willing to put some time aside to understand them better). This material should is there because someone of us found it useful in their research, so by using it you avoid having to "filter out" all of what a Google search might return you, and instead you can rely on resources that have been "tested and approved" by others before you.

Anyone can suggest new material to add, as long as it is related to work that is done in the [Computational Biomachanics Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/over/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering/research/biomechatronics-human-machine-control/computational-biomechanics-lab) at TU Delft.

Below you find a list of topics that are covered already:
- [Multibody Dynamics](https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/useful-resources/tree/main/Multibody%20Dynamics)
- [Optimization](https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/useful-resources/tree/main/Optimization)
